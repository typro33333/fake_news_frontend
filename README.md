## [ReactJS] + [WebPack]

#### [Go to the Porject]
- `cd ` + name of folder you set this respo.

### If you want development this application more and more
#### Config Webpack for suitable of your opnion.
- We have save all file config in folder ` webpack `
```bash
|-Repo
| |-webpack
|   |-webpack.common.js
|   |-webpack.dev.js
|   |-webpack.prod.js

```
##### [You can change config webpack at file webpack.config.js]
<a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/">
    Watch more to config webpack like input,output,etc.
</a>

#### [Install all package need]
- `npm install`

#### [Run as develop enviroment]
- `npm run dev`

#### [Run build web for deploy on server]
- `npm run build`

##### [Gencode proto file to JS]
- For communication with http2.0 all server always have file protobuf tranfer. All this file will be generated by grpc of google. At here we have two file proto for this generate.
` protoc -I. ./protobuf/train.proto --js_out=import_style=commonjs,binary:./src --grpc-web_out=import_style=commonjs,mode=grpcwebtext:./src `

` protoc -I. ./protobuf/serve.proto --js_out=import_style=commonjs,binary:./src --grpc-web_out=import_style=commonjs,mode=grpcwebtext:./src `

##### [For communication with the server need enable envoy proxy]
- Look at folder envoy proxy have 2 file:
```bash
|-envoy proxy
| |-docker-compose.yml
| |-envoy.yml

```
- Default application will communication with envoy at port: 8080
- Default server will listener envoy at port: 9090
- You can change this port in envoy.yml but don't need change port 9901 that port application envoy. When done all file run this script to deploy envoy by docker.
- ` docker compose up `
- Don't forget move in to envoy proxy:
- ` cd envoy proxy`
